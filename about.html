    <h2>5th UN Global Road Safety week "Leadership for Road Safety"</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The 5th UN Global Road Safety Week, “Leadership for Road safety” took place on 6-12 May 2019. Its goal was to generate demand from the public for stronger leadership for road safety worldwide. Stronger leadership is needed to advance road
      safety within the United Nations system. We encourage Road Safety Focal Points for the UN-system to promote UN Road Safety Week and highlight how all UN personnel can be leaders for road safety by being safer road users and identify specific
      risks on the road in the communities they serve. New road safety campaign materials are available on a public platform and the UNDSS public website. Share these materials with your staff to communicate road safety awareness and make use of
      digital logos in your email correspondence. There are also road safety awareness materials for staff and management, road safety management standards and a road safety management toolkit to support country-led activities and implementation of
      the UN internal Road Safety Strategy.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Why the Road Safety Strategy is important to us?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Road crashes are a leading cause of death and serious injury to United Nations personnel. In fact, road crashes kill more UN staff than terrorism. The United Nations is committed to curbing road crashes among its staff: for the first time a
      single, holistic road safety management approach will be implemented to halve the number of UN personnel or other road users killed or seriously injured in road crashes involving UN vehicles. The UN-wide Road Safety Strategy will manage the
      interaction between speed, vehicles, road-user behavior, and road infrastructure. Fatal crashes are preventable. That’s why safer journeys begin with us.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>About 5th UNGRSW</h2>
    <br>
    <p>On 28 February 2019 the UN Road Safety Strategy was launched in New York and Geneva. More than 250 participants from the UN-system, Member States, civil society and philanthropic organizations, academia and the private sector attended the
      launch at UNHQ. UN leaders from UNDP, UNDSS, DOS, DPO, DPPA, UNFPA, the Medical Director’s Working Group; including the Chef de Cabinet and the SG’s Special Envoy on Road Safety showed unity and shared a consistent message on the importance
      and urgency of road safety across the UN. Their personal anecdotes helped engage the audience. New road safety campaign materials were created, including branding, flyers and two road safety films, for outreach on the UN Road Safety Strategy.
      The New York launch broke new ground by introducing elements not typically seen in UN meetings, including an interactive quiz, staff testimonials and the sharing of external best practices.
